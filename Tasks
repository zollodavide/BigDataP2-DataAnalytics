ANALYSIS TASKS:

1. Is there a police vs race problem in the US? For making such a conclusion one should analyze how many
	unjust killings occured against a specific race.
What is an unjust kill? When the victim is unarmed, the threat level is not attack and 
	the victim is not trying to run away. 
Compare total unjust killings with every race.
Top states with most unjust killings (vs race).

1.5. Suspicious police officer: No body camera, unarmed victim, no threat level (, race of victim)

2. Relation in states between: 
	High school rate vs poverty rate vs (vs kill rate?)
	 -> possible conclusion: low high school graduation rate -> high criminality
   	Killings in states with high Unemployment rate vs signs of mental illness
   	 -> possible conclusion: high unemployment rate -> more mental illness
	 
3. GENERAL FACTS:
	 Median household income in the US. 
	 Poverty rate in the US.
	 Graduation Rate in the US.
	 Share Race in the US.
	 Unemployment Rate in the US.
	 

Why is this analysis important:
If the results of the analysis point to the fact that there's a race vs police problem, you could use 
this information to tackle the problem. In states with high a ratio, one could enforce more police control,
or even defund police stations.
